Difference between likelihood and probability with a few examples

## Likelihood vs Probability

Likelihood:

Likelihood is a measure of how well a particular set of data or observations fits a specific hypothesis or model. It assesses the plausibility or compatibility of the observed data with a given hypothesis. Likelihood is often used in statistical inference and parameter estimation. It does not necessarily represent the actual probability of an event occurring.

Probability:

Probability is a measure of the likelihood or chance that a particular event will occur. It quantifies the likelihood of different outcomes happening based on the information available. Probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event is impossible, and 1 means the event is certain to happen. It represents the long-term relative frequency of an event occurring if it is repeated multiple times.

### Examples:

1. Coin Toss:

   Suppose you have a fair coin, and you flip it 10 times. If you observe that it lands on heads 7 times and tails 3 times,

   - Likelihood: In this case, likelihood refers to how well the observed data (7 heads, 3 tails) fit the hypothesis that the coin is fair. We can calculate the likelihood of getting this specific outcome under the assumption of a fair coin.
   
   - ( Likelihood: මෙම අවස්ථාවෙහිදී, Likelihood යනු නිරීක්ෂණය කරන ලද දත්ත (හිස් 7, වලිග 3) කාසිය සාධාරණයි යන උපකල්පනයට කෙතරම් හොඳින් ගැලපේද යන්නයි. සාධාරණ කාසියක උපකල්පනය යටතේ මෙම නිශ්චිත ප්රතිඵලය ලබා ගැනීමේ Likelihood ගණනය කළ හැකිය.)
   - Probability: Probability represents the long-term relative frequency. For example, the probability of flipping heads on a fair coin is 0.5.

3. Medical Test:

   Suppose there is a medical test for a disease claiming to be 95% accurate. If you take the test and the result comes back positive,

   - Likelihood: Likelihood would measure how well the observed test result (positive) fits the hypothesis that you have the disease.
   - Probability: Probability indicates the actual chances of having the disease based on the test result. The accuracy of the test doesn't solely determine the probability of having the disease.

In summary, likelihood evaluates how well the observed data fits a hypothesis or model, while probability quantifies the chances of an event occurring or the long-term relative frequency of an outcome.

Example 1: Weather Forecast

- Likelihood: Let's say a weather forecaster predicts a 70% chance of rain tomorrow. The likelihood, in this case, refers to how well the observed weather conditions (such as cloud cover, humidity, etc.) fit the forecasted probability of rain.
- Probability: Probability represents the actual chances of rain occurring tomorrow. If the forecaster's predictions are accurate, the probability of rain would indeed be 70%.

Example 2: Product Quality Control

- Likelihood: In a manufacturing process, a quality control inspector checks a sample of products and identifies defects in 20% of them. The likelihood would assess how well the observed data (the percentage of defective products) fits the hypothesis that the manufacturing process is flawed.
- Probability: Probability, in this case, would represent the chances of an individual product being defective. If the defect rate is 20%, the probability of any randomly selected product being defective would be 0.2.

Example 3: Sports Betting

- Likelihood: Suppose you analyze the performance of two soccer teams, Team A and Team B, and based on their previous matches, you estimate that Team A has a 60% chance of winning the upcoming match. The likelihood would measure how well the observed data (past performance and statistics) fits the estimated probability of Team A winning.
- Probability: Probability represents the actual chances of Team A winning the match. If the estimated probability of 60% is accurate, then the probability of Team A winning would be 0.6.

In each example, likelihood evaluates the fit between observed data and a hypothesis, while probability quantifies the chances of an event or outcome happening.
